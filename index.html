                                         <p>Bergling was a member of the Laidback Luke Forums, where
                                            he refined his craft and, at times, demonstrated his distinct
                                            deep house style. By 2009 to 2010, Bergling was a prolific
                                            producer and was releasing music incredibly quickly. His
                                            remixes during this period were "Sound of Now", "Muja", "Ryu"
                                            and "Even". Then, in 2010, Bergling released the hit song "Seek
                                            Bromance", which reached the top 20 in several countries,
                                            including Belgium, France, the Netherlands, United Kingdom,
                                            and Sweden.</p>

                                            into the mainstream. The song reached the top ten in
